# Volatility Heatmap

A 2D heatmap representation of the volatility surface of a certain stock. To use, enter a stock name and the option type you are interested in for that stock. 

The program also returns a volatility smile graph and a volatility term structure graph.


# Process

As I've been learning more about options theory, I wanted to explore the idea of transformaing the traditional 3D volatility surface into a 2D representation by using a heatmap. Note that this is just Version 1 of the project -- I intend on elevating the UI and even the architecture of the program at some point.
